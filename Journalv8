Error: Error in output$plot <-
 renderPlot({ : object 'output' not found
Solution: I had sourced in a different file which I had copied the code into
          for safe-keeping. However, I had the same code in the server so
          thought there was something wrong with the server.

Error: Colours of points on plot were the same so I thought only
      one plot had been plotted.
Solution: I changed the colours to stand out against each other.
